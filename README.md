# logger

A tiny console wrapper that adds timestamps and the calling class name while retaining correct line numbers.

## But I can just turn on timestamps in the browser...

True but it's hard enough to get people to send you decent logs to begin with so you don't want to have to tell them to turn timestamps on as well. If you want timestamps it's more reliable just to print them yourself.
